  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>Wildcats Biotech is a student-led organization at the University of Arizona committed to advancing career exploration, preparation, and development in the biotechnology sector. We provide students with direct access to professionals from startups, regulatory agencies, consulting firms, and pharmaceutical companies to learn from their personal experiences—successes and setbacks alike.</p>

  <p>We organize professional development events including Roche campus tours, alumni and industry panels, and resume-building workshops. Our community fosters engagement between undergraduate and graduate students and the broader biotech ecosystem through networking opportunities, LinkedIn profile sessions, and mock interviews with hiring managers.</p>

  <p>Our regular meetings help members set and reflect on personal career goals, and we actively share curated resources and opportunities to accelerate their development.
